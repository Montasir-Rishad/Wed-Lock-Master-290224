**Features:**
Wed-Lock Master is basically a Matrimonial Software project which comes with various features including the following:
1. User-friendly platform for finding partners.
2. Secure personalized accounts.
3. Easy filtering for bride/groom search.
4. Community engagement via blogs.
5. Direct chatting for communication.
6. Rental car advertising option.
7. Admin Panel for smooth operation.
8. Ensures seamless, secure experience.


**Bakground Study:**
Before developing a matrimonial website, we studied existing websites in Bangladesh, including-
1. Bangladeshi Matrimony, 
2. BD Marriage, 
3. Noble Marriage, and 
4. Badhon Matrimony. 
We found that the UI/UX of these websites was uncomfortably poor, & the design was outdated. Then we decided to create an optimum website that would provide better facilities for free, offering a new way to find partners. We also planned to implement robust power in the admin panel to enhance the existing matrimonial system.
